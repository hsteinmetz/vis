# Getting Started
First, install all dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```sh
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

# Developing

Once you've installed dependencies, start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

# Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
